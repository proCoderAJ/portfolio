# Formspree Setup Guide for Contact Form

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

Your contact form is already integrated with Formspree! You just need to get your unique form ID to make it work.

### Step 1: Sign up for Formspree
1. Go to [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's free!)
3. Create an account with your email

### Step 2: Create a New Form
1. After signing in, click "New Form"
2. Enter your email: `abhishekjoshi2026@gmail.com`
3. Give it a name like "Portfolio Contact Form"
4. Click "Create Form"

### Step 3: Get Your Form ID
1. You'll see a form endpoint like: `https://formspree.io/f/xblrjkdl`
2. Copy the part after `/f/` (example: `xblrjkdl`)
3. This is your **Form ID**

### Step 4: Update Your Code
1. Open `src/pages/Contact.jsx`
2. Find line 497: `'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID'`
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Form ID
4. Also update line 676: `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"`

### Example:
If your Form ID is `xblrjkdl`, change:
```javascript
// Line 497
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xblrjkdl', {

// Line 676  
action="https://formspree.io/f/xblrjkdl"
```
